[How to run the code](#how-to-run-the-code) <br>
[Todos](#todos)



<strong>Initial idea</strong>ðŸ’¡ <br>
Up until this point I have been comfortable making GET requests with fetch API, and I wanted to practice POST, DELETE and PUT methods as well in order to make a CRUD app.

<strong> What the code does </strong> <br>
A simple blog CRUD website (created with create-react-app) to improve my react with; using useState and useEffect hooks; API fetch calls and so forth. You can cread, read, update and delete blogs. There is also a search bar to search blogs by their title.

# How to run the code
```
1- clone the repository.

2- Install modules with <b>npm install

3- Activate json server. => npx json-server --watch api/blogs.json --port 8000(or any other available port)

4- npm start

```


# Todos

-Add pagination (or infinite scrolling?) maybe
